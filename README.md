# Maze-Runner

This Maze Runner application will find the shortest path through a given maze from a starting point to a goal inside the maze. The program will read a 
maze from a data file, create a visual representation of the maze, then generate a corresponding graph, perform a breadth-first search to find the shortest path (if one exists) and then print out the path and display visually.
